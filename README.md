# Unwrapped-Identity-LUT-Builder

Builds uncorrected, unwrapped identity LUTs for Unity3D and UDK

## Installation

You will need to install some wonderful 3rd-party python modules:

	pip install PIL numpy

## Usage

For the moment just setup the variables in main() and run:

	python UnwrappedIdentityLUTBuilder.py

## The Future

1. At the moment it only creates identity LUTs. Maybe it should accept Resolve .cube files and generated a corrected LUT?
